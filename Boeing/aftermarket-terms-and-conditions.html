<li><strong>PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR AFTERMARKET PARTS</strong>. This agreement (Agreement) is made by and between The Boeing Company acting through (a) Boeing Aftermarket Parts Solutions program or (b) PART Page Marketplace program, as applicable (Boeing) and the customer placing the order (Customer). This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Boeing and Customer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any other previous agreements, understandings, or communications between Boeing and Customer related thereto. </li>
<li><strong>DEFINITIONS.</strong> As used in this Agreement, "Aftermarket Parts" means previously-owned aircraft components in various conditions (overhauled, serviceable or "as-removed" condition) sold under this Agreement. Such Aftermarket Parts will include approved traceability documentation and certifications per FAA (AC) 20-62E and will not have been previously owned by a U.S. Government or Military sources. Aftermarket Parts will not exceed the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) time, life, or usage limits. 
</li>

<li><p class="paragraph"><strong>PAYMENT. </strong></p>
  <p class="paragraph">3.1 Terms. Payment will be made in United States dollars. Subject to approval of Customer's credit by Boeing, payment will be net 30 days after the date of the Boeing invoice. In the event payments are not made when due, Boeing reserves the right to assert whatever remedies it may have, including, but not limited to, requiring full payment in advance or altering the terms of payment. </p>
<p class="paragraph">3.2 Late Payments. Amounts due Boeing that are not paid within forty-five (45) days after the invoice date will be subject to a late payment charge. Such charge will be computed monthly using the prime rate in effect as published and defined in the Wall Street Journal on the fifteenth (15th) day of the month as adjusted month to month, plus two percent (2%). If the fifteenth (15th) day of the month falls on either a Saturday, Sunday, or a United States federal holiday, Boeing will use the rate published on the next business day. Such rate will be applied on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365)-day year against the past-due amount, commencing on the forty-sixth (46th) day after the invoice date and continuing until payment is received by Boeing. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>TAXES.</strong> "Taxes" are defined as all taxes, fees, charges or duties and any interest, penalties, fines, or other additions to tax, including, but not limited to, sales, use, value-added, gross receipts, stamp, excise, transfer and similar taxes imposed by any domestic or foreign taxing authority arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any order. Except for U.S. federal and U.S. state income taxes and Washington State business and occupation tax imposed on Boeing, Customer will be responsible for and pay all Taxes. 
</li>

<li><strong>DELIVERY, TITLE and RISK OF LOSS.</strong> Delivery of Aftermarket Parts and other items will be Free on Board (F.O.B.), as defined by the Uniform Commercial Code, Boeing's plant, Seattle, Washington, or such other Boeing shipping point or distribution center from which the item is shipped in fulfillment of an order and is made upon placing an item in the possession of the carrier. Title and risk of loss will pass from Boeing to Customer upon delivery. </li>

<li><strong>CHANGES.</strong> From time to time, Boeing may make a substitution of an Aftermarket Part due to the lack in availability of Aftermarket Parts at the time the Customer places an order. Boeing will promptly give Customer notification when substitutions are made that affect interchangeability, quality, condition, or require a price adjustment. </li>

<li><p class="paragraph"><strong>CANCELLATION.</strong> Customer may cancel an order for Aftermarket Parts at any time prior to delivery, provided that Boeing will be entitled to receive a cancellation charge in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="paragraph">a) If Aftermarket Parts have not been shipped from Boeing or from a Boeing vendor, no cancellation charge will be made. </p>
<p class="paragraph">b) If Aftermarket Parts have been shipped from Boeing or a Boeing vendor, cancellation charges will range between twenty percent (20%) and one hundred percent (100%) of the price of the Aftermarket Parts ordered (based on return), but will not exceed the total price of the Aftermarket Parts ordered. </p>
<p class="paragraph">c) If time or material charges have been made, the cancellation charge will be based on such charges, but will not exceed the price of the Aftermarket Parts ordered. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE.</strong> All Parts will be subject to inspection by Customer at destination. Use of Aftermarket Parts or failure of Customer to give notice of rejection within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Aftermarket Parts, whichever first occurs, will constitute Customer's acceptance of Aftermarket Parts received. Any notice of rejection will specify the reasons for rejection and Boeing will correct, repair or replace any Aftermarket Part rightfully rejected. Upon receipt of Boeing's written instructions, Customer will return rejected Aftermarket Parts to Boeing, at Seattle, Washington, or other mutually agreeable destination. Return to Boeing of such Aftermarket Parts and return to Customer of corrected, repaired or replacement Aftermarket Parts will be at Boeing's expense. </li>
<li><strong>EXCUSABLE DELAY.</strong> Boeing will not be liable for any delay in performance hereunder caused by: (i) acts of God; (ii) war or armed hostilities; (iii) government acts or priorities; (iv) fires, floods, or earthquakes; (v) strikes or labor troubles causing cessation, slowdown or interruption of work; (vi) delivery to anyone pursuant to an Aircraft on Ground (AOG) or critical request affecting any aspect of Boeing's performance identified to an order; (vii) inability, after due and timely diligence, to procure materials, systems, accessories, equipment, or parts; or (viii) any other cause to the extent such cause is beyond Boeing's control and not occasioned by Boeing's fault or negligence. A delay resulting from any such cause is defined as an Excusable Delay and the date for completion of Boeing's performance will be equitably extended. </li>
<li> <p class="paragraph"><strong>WARRANTIES, REMEDIES, AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES.</strong></p>
  <p class="paragraph"><strong>10.1 WARRANTY OF AFTERMARKET PARTS.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong>10.1.1</strong> Boeing warrants that each Aftermarket Part will at the time of delivery: (i) conform to (a) the applicable drawing or (b) in the case of repaired and overhauled serviceable Parts, applicable engineering and rework and repair documentation; and (ii) be fit for installation and use according to its part number and certification basis. The following conditions do not constitute a breach of this warranty: (i) conditions resulting from normal wear and tear; (ii) conditions resulting from acts or omissions of Customer; and (iii) conditions resulting from failure to properly service and maintain an Aftermarket Part.</p> 
<p class="paragraph"><strong>10.1.2</strong> Customer's remedy and Boeing's obligation and liability with respect to a breach of this warranty, is limited to repair or replacement of a warrantable Aftermarket Part, at Boeing's option. Such remedies are conditioned upon the following: (i) discovery of a breach of this warranty by Customer on a covered Aftermarket Part within twelve (12) months after delivery of the Aftermarket Part; (ii) receipt by Boeing of written notice of a breach of this warranty from Customer no later than ninety (90) days after expiration of the applicable warranty period; (iii) unless a warrantable condition is corrected by Customer, prompt return of a warrantable Aftermarket Part at Customer's expense to Boeing's plant or to another mutually agreeable location; and (iv) sufficient information to substantiate Customer's claim. Customer's shipping expenses will be reimbursed by Boeing upon confirmation by Boeing of the warrantable condition. Return to Customer of an Aftermarket Part repaired or replaced under warranty will be at Boeing's expense. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong>10.1.3</strong> Title to and risk of loss of any Aftermarket Part returned to Boeing pursuant to Section 8 or this Section 10 will at all times remain with Customer. While Boeing has possession of the returned Aftermarket Part, Boeing will have only such liabilities as a bailee for mutual benefit would have, but will not be liable for loss of use. Upon delivery by Boeing to Customer of a replacement Aftermarket Part, title to and risk of loss for the returned Aftermarket Part will pass to Boeing and title to and risk of loss for the replacement Aftermarket Part will pass to Customer. Notices to Boeing under this Section 10 will be addressed to Boeing's Warranty Regional Manager. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong>10.1.4</strong> Notwithstanding the above warranty, each Aftermarket Part purchased in an "as-removed" condition is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind. The warranties, obligations and liabilities of Boeing and the remedies of Customer provided herein do not apply to such Aftermarket Parts.</p> 
<p class="paragraph"><strong>10.2 EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES.</strong></p>
