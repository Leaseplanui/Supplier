	  <p class="paragraph">1. AGREEMENT AND ORDER OF PRECEDENCE. This agreement (Agreement) is made by and between The Boeing Company (Boeing) and the customer placing the order (Customer). If a Customer Services General Terms Agreement (CSGTA) or Hardware Materials Services General Terms Agreement (HMSGTA) or other applicable written agreement exists between Customer and Boeing, the terms of the CSGTA, HMSGTA, or other applicable written agreement will apply in accordance with its terms to the parts that Customer orders from Boeing. If there is no CSGTA or HMSGTA, or other applicable written agreement between Customer and Boeing, then the terms and conditions provided to Customer or in Customer's possession and set forth herein will apply to the parts. In the absence of a CSGTA, HMSGTA, or other applicable agreement, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Boeing and Customer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any other agreements, understandings, and communications between Boeing and Customer related thereto.</p>
      
	  <p class="paragraph">2. DEFINITIONS. As used in the Agreement, "Aircraft Software" means software intended to fly with and be utilized in the operation of an aircraft. "Parts" means goods sold under this Agreement (including Aircraft Software). "Leased Parts" means Parts leased, not sold, from Boeing by Customer under this Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">3. PAYMENT. Payment will be made in United States dollars. Subject to approval of Customer's credit by Boeing, payment will be net 30 days after the date of the Boeing invoice. In the event payments are not made when due, Boeing reserves the right to assert whatever remedies it may have, including, but not limited to, requiring full payment in advance or altering the terms of payment. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">Amounts due Boeing that are not paid within 45 days after the invoice date will be subject to a late payment charge. Such charge will be computed monthly using the prime rate in effect as published and defined in the Wall Street Journal on the 15th day of the month as adjusted month to month, plus 2%. If the 15th day of the month falls on either a Saturday, Sunday, or a United States federal holiday, Boeing will use the rate published on the next business day. Such rate will be applied on the basis of a 365-day year against the past-due amount, commencing on the 46th day after the invoice date and continuing until payment is received by Boeing.</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">4. TAXES. "Taxes" are defined as all taxes, fees, charges or duties and any interest, penalties, fines, or other additions to tax, including, but not limited to, sales, use, value-added, gross receipts, stamp, excise, transfer and similar taxes imposed by any domestic or foreign taxing authority arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any order. Except for U.S. federal and U.S. state income taxes and Washington State business and occupation tax imposed on Boeing, Customer will be responsible for and pay all Taxes. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">5. PACKING. Boeing will pack the Parts for domestic or export shipment, as specified by Customer.</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">6. DELIVERY. Delivery of Parts and Leased Parts and other items will be Free on Board (F.O.B.), as defined by the Uniform Commercial Code, Boeing's plant, Seattle, Washington, or such other Boeing shipping point or distribution center from which the item is shipped in fulfillment of an order and is made upon placing an item in the possession of the carrier. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">7. QUANTITY TOLERANCE. Delivery of any Part, wherein the unit price does not exceed USD 25.00, is subject to a quantity tolerance of plus or minus 5% of the quantity specified. Boeing will adjust the order price to compensate for any overshipment or undershipment.</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">8. CHANGES. From time to time, Boeing may make necessary corrections or changes in the design, part number and nomenclature of Parts. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, Boeing may without Customer's consent substitute for spare parts ordered by Customer other spare parts and adjust prices accordingly, provided that interchangeability is not affected and the unit price is not increased by more than 10%. Boeing will promptly give Customer written notice when substitutions and price adjustments are made to Customer orders. Substitutions that affect interchangeability or price adjustments that exceed the price limitations set forth above may be made only with Customer's consent, which consent will conclusively be deemed to have been given unless Customer gives Boeing written notice of objection within 15 business days after receipt of Boeing's notice. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">9. CANCELLATION. Customer may cancel an order for Parts at any time prior to delivery, provided that Boeing will be entitled to receive a cancellation charge in accordance with the following:</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">a) If work accomplished has been limited to Boeing's Spares Department, no cancellation charge will be made.</p>
	  <p class="paragraph">b) If production planning has been completed, but no time or material charges have been made, the cancellation charge will be 10% of the Part price. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">c) If time or material charges have been made, the cancellation charge will be based on such charges, but will not exceed the price of the Parts ordered. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">d) If the Parts can be absorbed into Boeing's inventory without increasing that inventory beyond Boeing's normal maximum stock level, no cancellation charge will be made. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">10. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE. All Parts will be subject to inspection by Customer at destination. Use of Parts or failure of Customer to give notice of rejection within 10 weeks after receipt of the Parts, whichever first occurs, will constitute Customer's acceptance of Parts received, including any overshipment or undershipment in excess of the quantity tolerance. Any notice of rejection will specify the reasons for rejection and Boeing will correct, repair or replace any Part rightfully rejected. Upon receipt of Boeing's written instructions, Customer will return rejected Parts to Boeing, at Seattle, Washington, or other mutually agreeable destination. Return to Boeing of such Parts and return to Customer of corrected, repaired or replacement Parts will be at Boeing's expense. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">11. EXCUSABLE DELAY. Boeing will not be liable for any delay in performance hereunder caused by: (i) acts of God; (ii) war or armed hostilities; (iii) government acts or priorities; (iv) fires, floods, or earthquakes; (v) strikes or labor troubles causing cessation, slowdown or interruption of work; (vi) delivery to anyone pursuant to an Aircraft on Ground (AOG) or critical request affecting any aspect of Boeing's performance identified to an order; (vii) inability, after due and timely diligence, to procure materials, systems, accessories, equipment, or parts; or (viii) any other cause to the extent such cause is beyond Boeing's control and not occasioned by Boeing's fault or negligence. A delay resulting from any such cause is defined as an Excusable Delay and the date for completion of Boeing's performance will be equitably extended. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">12. WARRANTIES, REMEDIES, AND LIMITATIONS. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">12.1 WARRANTY OF PARTS MANUFACTURED TO BOEING’S DETAILED DESIGN. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">12.1.1 Boeing warrants that each Part manufactured to Boeing's detailed design will at the time of delivery: (i) conform to the applicable drawing and specification; (ii) be free from defects in material and workmanship; and (iii) be free from defects in design in view of the state of the art at the time of design. These warranties will not apply to Parts not manufactured to Boeing's detailed design. The following conditions do not constitute a defect under this warranty: (i) conditions resulting from normal wear and tear; (ii) conditions resulting from acts or omissions of Customer; and (iii) conditions resulting from failure to properly service and maintain a Part. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">12.1.2 Customer's remedy and Boeing's obligation and liability, with respect to a defect, is limited to repair or replacement of a defective Part at Boeing's option. Such remedies are conditioned upon the following: (i) discovery of a defect by Customer on a Boeing designed Part within the following periods after delivery: (forty-eight (48) months for Parts applicable to 737 Next Generation, 777 and any new Boeing model designed with similar, new technology; thirty-six (36) months for Parts applicable to any other Boeing aircraft model. In the case of any Part that may be used on an aircraft model with either the forty-eight (48) month warranty or the thirty-six (36) month warranty, the forty-eight (48) month warranty will apply in every instance); (ii) receipt by Boeing of written notice of a defect from Customer no later than ninety (90) days after expiration of the applicable warranty period; (iii) unless a defective Part is corrected by Customer, prompt return of a defective Part at Customer's expense to Boeing's plant or another mutually agreeable location; and (iv) sufficient information to substantiate Customer's claim. Customer's shipping expenses will be reimbursed by Boeing upon confirmation by Boeing of the covered defect. Return to Customer of a Part, repaired or replaced under warranty, will be at Boeing's expense. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">12.1.3 Title to and risk of loss of any Part returned to Boeing pursuant to Section 10 or this Section 12 will at all times remain with Customer, except that, at the time Boeing ships a replacement Part to Customer, title to and risk of loss for the defective, returned Part will pass to Boeing and title to and risk of loss for the replacement Part will pass to Customer. Notices to Boeing under this Section will be addressed to Boeing's Warranty Regional Manager. </p>
	  <p class="paragraph">12.2 Warranty of Leased Parts. Each Leased Part leased hereunder is leased "as is " and Boeing makes no warranty whatsoever with regard to them. A Leased Part purchased by Customer is a Part and, as such, the warranty is contained in Section 12.1. </p>
