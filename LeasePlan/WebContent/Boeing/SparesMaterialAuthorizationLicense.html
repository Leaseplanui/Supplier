Additionally, Customer further agrees to physically identify parts manufactured under this Authority, if practicable, with a unique character, code, symbol or other identifier to distinguish it as a product of the Customer, and not of Boeing. If parts are too small or otherwise impractical to mark in accordance with the BPI or BPM, a tag attached to the part(s) or its container must include the information that could not be marked on the part.</p>
