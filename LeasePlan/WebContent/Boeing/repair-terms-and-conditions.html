<p class="paragraph">AGREEMENT AND ORDER OF PRECEDENCE. This agreement  (Agreement) is made by and between The Boeing Company (Boeing) and the customer  placing the order (Customer). If a Customer Services General Terms Agreement  (CSGTA) or Hardware Materials Services General Terms Agreement (HMSGTA) or  other applicable written agreement exists between you and Boeing, the terms of  your CSGTA, HMSGTA, or other applicable written agreement will apply in  accordance with their terms to the parts and services that you order from  Boeing. If there is no CSGTA or HMSGTA, or other applicable written agreement  between you and Boeing, then the terms and conditions set forth in this  Agreement will apply. In the absence of a CSGTA, HMSGTA, or other applicable  agreement, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Boeing and  Customer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces  any other agreements, understandings, and communications between Boeing and  Customer related thereto. </p>
<p class="paragraph">DEFINITIONS. As used in the Agreement, ""Parts" means goods  repaired, overhauled, modified, remanufactured or provided as exchange goods  under this Agreement. </p>
<p class="paragraph">PACKING. Boeing will pack the Parts for domestic or export  shipment, as specified by Customer. </p>
<p class="paragraph">DELIVERY. Delivery of Parts will be Free on Board (F.O.B.)  Boeing's plant, Seattle, Washington, or such other Boeing shipping  point or distribution center from which the item is shipped in fulfillment of  an order and is made upon placing an item in the possession of the carrier. </p>
<p class="paragraph">NON-REPARABLE PARTS. Unless previously agreed, Boeing  considers any part Beyond Economical Repair (BER) if a repair will exceed 65%  of Boeing's then current sales price of a new replacement part. Boeing will  promptly notify Customer if, in Boeing's discretion, a Part is BER, and  Customer will instruct Boeing to either: (i) continue the repair with a  budgetary quote from Boeing; (ii) ship the Part to Customer at Customer's  expense; or (iii) destroy the Part. In the event Customer requests either (ii)  or (iii) above, Customer will pay to Boeing, Boeing's standard handling charge  then in effect. </p>
<p class="paragraph">CUSTOMER INSTRUCTIONS. Customer may provide with the Part  specific technical instructions for additional work to be performed on the  Part. The absence of such instructions will evidence Customer's authorization  for Boeing to perform all necessary repairs and work required to return the  Part to a serviceable condition.</p>
<p class="paragraph">TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS. Title to and risk of loss of any  Parts returned to Boeing will at all times remain with Customer or any other  title holder of such Part, except that components of such Parts removed and  replaced will pass to Boeing upon replacement. Title to replacement components  will pass to Customer upon redelivery to Customer. Title to Parts delivered to  Boeing for exchange with remanufactured, modified or overhauled Parts will pass  to Boeing upon delivery to Customer of the remanufactured, modified or  overhauled Parts. Title to such remanufactured, modified or overhauled Parts  will pass to Customer upon delivery to Customer. While Boeing has possession of  the returned Parts, Boeing will have only such liabilities as a bailee for  mutual benefit would have, but will not be liable for loss of use.</p>
<p class="paragraph">INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE. All Parts will be subject to  final inspection by Customer at destination. Use of Parts or failure to give  notice of rejection within 10 weeks after receipt will constitute acceptance of  Parts received. </p>
<p class="paragraph">WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.1 COVERAGE AND WARRANTY PERIOD. Boeing warrants that, at  the time of delivery, the repair, overhaul, modification made to each Part, or  the remanufacture or exchange Part, as applicable, will be free from defects in  material and workmanship for a period of 12 months after such delivery. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.2 CLAIMS. The claimed defect must be discovered by  Customer within the applicable warranty period, and Boeing Warranty must  receive written notice of such defect at the earliest practicable time after  discovery of the defect by Customer, but in no event later than 90 days after  expiration of the applicable warranty period. Such claim must include  reasonable evidence that the claimed defect is covered by one of the above  warranties and, if requested by Boeing, that such defect did not result from:  (i) conditions resulting from normal wear and tear; (ii) conditions resulting  from acts or omissions of Customer, and (iii) conditions resulting from failure  to properly service and maintain the Part. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.3 REMEDY. Customer's remedy for a defect in material and  workmanship in the Part is repair or replacement, at Boeing's option, of the  defective Part. If a replacement Part is provided, such replacement will be  interchangeable with the replaced part and be free from defect. Boeing's  liability and Customer's remedy under this Article 9.3 are conditioned upon the  return, as soon as practicable, of the defective Part, with all shipping  charges prepaid, to Boeing's location, from which such part was previously  delivered to Customer, or other mutually agreeable location. Upon confirmation  of the defect, Boeing will reimburse Customer's reasonable incoming shipping  charges. Return of the repaired or replacement Part will be at Boeing's  expense. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.4 WARRANTY OF TITLE. Boeing warrants that it will convey  good title to any replaced or exchanged component part provided with the Part  delivered to Customer from Boeing, and such part will be free and clear of all  liens, claims, charges and encumbrances. Boeing's liability and Customer's  remedy under this Article 9.4 are limited to the removal of any defect in title  or the replacement of any part having such a defect. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.5 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND RELEASE. THE WARRANTIES,  OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF BOEING AND THE REMEDIES OF CUSTOMER SET FORTH IN  THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN SUBSTITUTION FOR, AND CUSTOMER HEREBY  WAIVES, RELEASES AND RENOUNCES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES, OBLIGATIONS  AND LIABILITIES OF BOEING, AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIES OF  CUSTOMER AGAINST BOEING, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE, WITH  RESPECT TO ANY NONCONFORMANCE OR DEFECT IN ANY PARTS, OR OTHER THINGS PROVIDED  UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INDEMNITY AGAINST ACTUAL OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OR  THE LIKE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS; (B) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF  PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE; (C) ANY OBLIGATION,  LIABILITY, RIGHT, CLAIM OR REMEDY IN TORT, WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE  NEGLIGENCE OF BOEING; AND (D) ANY OBLIGATION, LIABILITY, RIGHT, CLAIM OR REMEDY  FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO ANY AIRCRAFT OR PART. </p>
<p class="paragraph">9.5.2 EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER DAMAGES. BOEING  WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT (INCLUDING  WARRANTY), TORT (WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF BOEING) OR  OTHERWISE, FOR LOSS OF USE, REVENUE OR PROFIT OR FOR ANY OTHER INCIDENTAL OR  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO ANY NONCONFORMANCE OR DEFECT IN ANY  PARTS, OR OTHER THINGS PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR, ANY INDEMNITY AGAINST  ACTUAL OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OR THE LIKE.</p>
<p class="paragraph">9.6 For the purpose of this Section 9, "BOEING" is  defined as The Boeing Company, its divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates, the  assignees of each, and their respective directors, officers, employees and  agents. </p>
<p class="paragraph">PAYMENT. Payment will be made in United States dollars. Subject to  approval of Customer's credit by Boeing, payment will be net 30 days after the  date of the Boeing invoice. Amounts due Boeing that are not paid within 45 days  after the invoice date will be subject to a late payment charge. Such charge  will be computed monthly using the prime rate in effect as published and  defined in the Wall Street Journal on the 15th day of the month as adjusted  month to month, plus 2%. If the 15th day of the month falls on either a Saturday,  Sunday, or a United States  federal holiday, Boeing will use the rate published on the next business day.  Such rate will be applied on the basis of a 365-day year against the past-due  amount, commencing on the 46th day after the invoice date and continuing until  payment is received by Boeing.</p>
<p class="paragraph">TAXES. "Taxes" are defined as all taxes, fees,  charges or duties and any interest, penalties, fines, or other additions to  tax, including, but not limited to, sales, use, value-added, gross receipts,  stamp, excise, transfer and similar taxes imposed by any domestic or foreign  taxing authority arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. Except  for U.S. federal and U.S. state income taxes and Washington State  business and occupation tax imposed on Boeing, Customer will be responsible for  and pay all Taxes. </p>
<p class="paragraph">EXCUSABLE DELAY. Boeing will not be liable for any delay in  performance of this Agreement caused by: (i) acts of God; (ii) war or armed  hostilities; (iii) government acts or priorities; (iv) fires, floods, or  earthquakes; (v) strikes or labor troubles causing cessation, slowdown or  interruption of work; (vi) delivery to anyone pursuant to an Aircraft on Ground  (AOG) or critical request affecting any aspect of Boeing's performance  identified to an order; (vii) inability, after due and timely diligence, to  procure materials, systems, accessories, equipment, or parts; or (viii) any  other cause to the extent such cause is beyond Boeing's control and not  occasioned by Boeing's fault or negligence. A delay resulting from any such  cause is defined as an Excusable Delay and the date for completion of Boeing's  performance will be equitably extended. </p>
